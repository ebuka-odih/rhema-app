      "14": "But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.",
      "15": "Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, \"Get out!\"",
      "16": "\"No,\" she answered. \"To send me away like this is a greater crime than what you just did!\" But Amnon would not listen to her;",
      "17": "he called in his personal servant and said, \"Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!\"",

      "20": "When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, \"Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half brother, so don't tell anyone about it.\" So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely.",
      "21": "When King David heard what had happened, he was furious.",

      "25": "\"No, my son,\" the king answered. \"It would be too much trouble for you if we all went.\" Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave.",
      "26": "But Absalom said, \"Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?\" \"Why should he?\" the king asked.",
      "27": "But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king",
      "28": "and instructed his servants: \"Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!\"",
      "29": "So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled.",
      "30": "While they were on their way home, David was told: \"Absalom has killed all your sons--not one of them is left!\"",
      "31": "The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also.",
      "32": "But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, \"Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.",
      "33": "So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed.\"",
      "34": "In the meantime Absalom had fled. Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim. He went to the king and reported what he had seen.",
      "35": "Jonadab said to David, \"Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would.\"",
      "36": "As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also cried bitterly.",

      "5": "His wife Jezebel went to him and asked, \"Why are you so depressed? Why won't you eat?\"",
      "6": "He answered, \"Because of what Naboth said to me. I offered to buy his vineyard or, if he preferred, to give him another one for it, but he told me that I couldn't have it!\"",
      "7": "\"Well, are you the king or aren't you?\" Jezebel replied. \"Get out of bed, cheer up, and eat. I will get you Naboth's vineyard!\"",

      "29": "Elisha turned to Gehazi and said, \"Hurry! Take my walking stick and go. Don't stop to greet anyone you meet, and if anyone greets you, don't take time to answer. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.\"",

      "40": "And then there will be a fourth empire, as strong as iron, which shatters and breaks everything. And just as iron shatters everything, it will shatter and crush all the earlier empires.",
      "41": "You also saw that the feet and the toes were partly clay and partly iron. This means that it will be a divided empire. It will have something of the strength of iron, because there was iron mixed with the clay.",
      "42": "The toes--partly iron and partly clay--mean that part of the empire will be strong and part of it weak.",
      "43": "You also saw that the iron was mixed with the clay. This means that the rulers of that empire will try to unite their families by intermarriage, but they will not be able to, any more than iron can mix with clay.",
      "44": "At the time of those rulers the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. It will never be conquered, but will completely destroy all those empires and then last forever.",
      "45": "You saw how a stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it and how it struck the statue made of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God is telling Your Majesty what will happen in the future. I have told you exactly what you dreamed, and have given you its true meaning.\"",

      "11": "So then, whether it came from me or from them, this is what we all preach, and this is what you believe.",

      "13": "If that is true, it means that Christ was not raised;",
      "14": "and if Christ has not been raised from death, then we have nothing to preach and you have nothing to believe.",
      "15": "More than that, we are shown to be lying about God, because we said that he raised Christ from death--but if it is true that the dead are not raised to life, then he did not raise Christ.",

      "17": "And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is a delusion and you are still lost in your sins.",

      "19": "If our hope in Christ is good for this life only and no more, then we deserve more pity than anyone else in all the world.",
      "20": "But the truth is that Christ has been raised from death, as the guarantee that those who sleep in death will also be raised.",
      "21": "For just as death came by means of a man, in the same way the rising from death comes by means of a man.",
      "22": "For just as all people die because of their union with Adam, in the same way all will be raised to life because of their union with Christ.",
      "23": "But each one will be raised in proper order: Christ, first of all; then, at the time of his coming, those who belong to him.",
      "24": "Then the end will come; Christ will overcome all spiritual rulers, authorities, and powers, and will hand over the Kingdom to God the Father.",
      "25": "For Christ must rule until God defeats all enemies and puts them under his feet.",
      "26": "The last enemy to be defeated will be death.",

      "28": "But when all things have been placed under Christ's rule, then he himself, the Son, will place himself under God, who placed all things under him; and God will rule completely over all.",
      "29": "Now, what about those people who are baptized for the dead? What do they hope to accomplish? If it is true, as some claim, that the dead are not raised to life, why are those people being baptized for the dead?",
      "30": "And as for us--why would we run the risk of danger every hour?",
      "31": "My friends, I face death every day! The pride I have in you, in our life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord, makes me declare this.",

      "36": "You fool! When you plant a seed in the ground, it does not sprout to life unless it dies.",
      "37": "And what you plant is a bare seed, perhaps a grain of wheat or some other grain, not the full-bodied plant that will later grow up.",
      "38": "God provides that seed with the body he wishes; he gives each seed its own proper body.",
      "39": "And the flesh of living beings is not all the same kind of flesh; human beings have one kind of flesh, animals another, birds another, and fish another.",
      "40": "And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; the beauty that belongs to heavenly bodies is different from the beauty that belongs to earthly bodies.",
      "41": "The sun has its own beauty, the moon another beauty, and the stars a different beauty; and even among stars there are different kinds of beauty.",
      "42": "This is how it will be when the dead are raised to life. When the body is buried, it is mortal; when raised, it will be immortal.",
      "43": "When buried, it is ugly and weak; when raised, it will be beautiful and strong.",
      "44": "When buried, it is a physical body; when raised, it will be a spiritual body. There is, of course, a physical body, so there has to be a spiritual body.",
      "45": "For the scripture says, \"The first man, Adam, was created a living being\"; but the last Adam is the life-giving Spirit.",
      "46": "It is not the spiritual that comes first, but the physical, and then the spiritual.",
      "47": "The first Adam, made of earth, came from the earth; the second Adam came from heaven.",
      "48": "Those who belong to the earth are like the one who was made of earth; those who are of heaven are like the one who came from heaven.",
      "49": "Just as we wear the likeness of the man made of earth, so we will wear the likeness of the Man from heaven.",
      "50": "What I mean, friends, is that what is made of flesh and blood cannot share in God's Kingdom, and what is mortal cannot possess immortality.",
      "53": "For what is mortal must be changed into what is immortal; what will die must be changed into what cannot die.",
      "54": "So when this takes place, and the mortal has been changed into the immortal, then the scripture will come true: \"Death is destroyed; victory is complete!\"",
